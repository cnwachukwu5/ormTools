# ormTools
## Introduction

I am a graduate student of Computer Science in Northern Kentucky University.
I am developing this project to demonstrate skills acquired from both class work and personal study. The essence is to help anyone who wants to learn how to implement enterprise solutions on Java EE platform. The repo contains my thoughts on design (Schema and application) and actual implementation. Hope you find it helpful.

Please feel free to make any contribution, I am always willing to learn.

# Spring MVC, SpringData and Primefaces

This project is executed to demonstrate:
1. the use of JSF, PrimeFaces, Spring MVC and Spring Data to implement enterprise solutions.
2. the integration of these APIs and frameworks to create a robust 3-tier enterprise application.

# Overview

The project (ORMToolS) is based on five years experience working as Operational Risk Management (ORM) Officer in the Banking Industry in Nigeria. Much of the processes were manually executed. This project sought to automate two of the major processes namely 
a. Disaster Management Register
b. Key Risk Indicator collection, analysis and reporting.

# Functional Specification and design architecture

In the repo, you will find a file "project-document.docx". It contains details of the functional spec, the architecture of the application, the site map. I also included the ER diagram for the database, the UML diagram  for the various usecases, the classes and their interactions.

# Updates
Updates will be posted at completion of every stage of the cycle. As I try to adopt the agile process, changes will be made on some uploaded documents or code at undetermined intervals.
